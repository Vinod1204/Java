Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995. It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. It is used for: Mobile applications (specially Android apps) Desktop applications.
Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.

Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.

A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes. It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.

In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream

Let's see the code to print output and an error message to the console.
