Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays with each element of the array holding the reference of other arrays.
These are also known as Jagged Arrays. A multidimensional array is created by appending one set of square brackets ([]) per dimension. 

Syntax :

datatype [][] arrayrefvariable;

or 

datatype arrayrefvariable[][];

Example:

int[][] intArray = new int[10][20]; //a 2D array or matrix
int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array
